Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!

ubuntu server:
Considering server is Ubuntu.
apt-get update 
apt-get upgrade 
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
sudo systemctl status docker

sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}==>non-root user has permission to run docker commands

cat /etc/docker/daemon.json

{
  "log-driver": "syslog",
  "log-opts": {
    "syslog-address": "udp/tcp"
  }
}

To find the current default logging driver for the Docker daemon
docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'

To find the current logging driver for a running container
docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' <CONTAINER>
